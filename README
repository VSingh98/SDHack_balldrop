## Inspiration

We were inspired with the Myo armband and thought that a game would be a great use of its inputs.

## What it does

Our game takes input from the Myo armband and turns the in-game paddle to divert falling balls to their required places in order to gain points.

## How I built it

We built the game using Unity 5.2 and C#. We used the Myo sdk to connect the Myo armband to our Unity game.

## Challenges I ran into

The biggest challenge we faced was making the Myo armband control the game's paddle. We also faced many challenges in making the game itself with Unity.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Making it work! We accomplished most of what we set out to do. We're proud of finishing it even though we knew nothing of the technologies we had to use.

## What I learned

We learned Unity and how to use Myo from scratch.

## What's next for Myo Ball Slap

Adding more platform support and multiple levels.
